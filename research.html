									<p style="font-weight:bold">Who Trusts State-Run Media? Polarized Perceptions of News Credibility in Non-Democracies</p>
									<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3686299" target="_blank">View at SSRN</a>; poster with key results <a href="files/Shirikov_CESS_poster.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> (presented at NYU CESS conference in 2021); a blog post about my main findings <a href="https://jordanrussiacenter.org/news/truth-unclaimed-why-russians-trust-propaganda-and-distrust-independent-media/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
									<p>
									How do citizens judge news messages in an environment flooded with misinformation? I investigate this question in the context of Russia, an authoritarian regime where the government systematically spreads falsehoods via state media. I propose that citizens are prone to false belief-consistent messages, and I suggest two mechanisms responsible for such vulnerability---confirmation bias and consumption of like-minded media. In two large-scale surveys, in which over 47,000 respondents evaluated 82 true and false news headlines, I demonstrate that consumption of propaganda does not substantially impair citizens' general ability to detect falsehoods. However, regime supporters and critics strongly disagree about the veracity of political news stories, especially if they use politically congruent media. As a result, supporters are vulnerable to propaganda-consistent misinformation, whereas critics often fall for propaganda-inconsistent falsehoods. Such biased news perceptions may help governments spread propaganda among sympathetic citizens, but they also mean that propaganda is unlikely to convince government critics.</p>

									<p>
									How do citizens make judgments about news information in authoritarian regimes? I theorize that in contemporary autocracies, as the availability of information sources increases, citizens can sort into consuming like-minded news, and they are vulnerable to false messages that are consistent with their political dispositions and with the slant of their preferred media. I test this expectation using two surveys, in which over 47,000 Russians evaluated more than 80 true and false news headlines. On average, citizens who learn news from state media and those who support Russian President Vladimir Putin are slightly less correct in their evaluations than opposition-minded respondents and those who consume non-state media. However, as hypothesized, the former often fail to recognize false messages with a pro-government slant, whereas the latter often fall for falsehoods that go against propaganda narratives. Both groups are less likely to correctly assess true incongruent messages. Those Putin supporters and critics who consume politically congruent media disagree about news veracity even more strongly. These biases have important implications for our understanding of citizens' political knowledge and for the popularity of authoritarian rule.</p>

									<p style="font-weight:bold">Is Trust in Media Decreasing? Evidence from the World Values Survey</p>
									<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3754404" target="_blank">View at SSRN</a></p>

									<p>
									Scholars and observers are increasingly concerned that confidence in mainstream media is decreasing, which could undermine the democratic political process and make citizens more vulnerable to manipulation. Various surveys have documented dwindling confidence in media in the U.S. and other democracies, but so far this research has not established whether this decline is a global trend. I suggest a more robust approach using data from the World Values Survey to establish worldwide trends in attitudes. The resulting analysis shows there has been some decline in confidence in media since the early 1990s, but there is no evidence of a decline among stable democracies. Confidence in media has been decreasing instead in democratizing countries and other states that have undergone substantial political changes.</p>

									<p><b>A Model of Censorship, Propaganda, and Repression</b> <i>(With Scott Gehlbach, Zhaotian Luo, and Dmitriy Vorobyev)</i></p>
									<p>
									A fundamental constraint of information design is that propaganda must be believed to be effective. The presence of outside information tightens this constraint. We extend the canonical two-state, two-action of Bayesian persuasion to endogenize the presence of such information. The sender (government) chooses both the precision of an outside signal—it chooses a level of censorship—and a probability distribution over propaganda messages, where the distribution can be conditioned on the outside signal. The government bears an opportunity cost of censorship, in that the government relies on outside information to decide whether to repress rather than persuade. In equilibrium, the government may employ censorship and propaganda alongside repression; many combinations of propaganda and censorship may be behaviorally equivalent. Under plausible additional assumptions, we predict a positive correlation between censorship and propaganda that is decreasing in the cost of repression.</p>

									<p><b>Is Postcommunism Over? What Is and Is Not Distinctive About Eastern Europe and Eurasia Three Decades After Communism</b> <i>(With Dmitrii Kofanov and Yoshiko M. Herrera)</i></p>
									<p>
									The meaning and distinctiveness of the postcommunist region has been hotly debated since the end of the Cold War. In this paper we return to the question posed by regional scholars just after the end of the USSR and in the intervening years, and ask how similar are the 28 post-communist countries to each other anymore, and how different are they from other countries in the world? In other words, is postcommunism over? If not, what are the variables that distinguish the postcommunist region, and what is actually captured by a post-communist regional dummy variable? We find limited evidence that postcommunist countries are distinct from the rest of the world in terms of demographic, economic, political, social, and value-based dimensions or that they coherently group together, and what had distinguished them has lessened over time. This analysis provides a more systematic understanding of the heterogeneity of postcommunist countries, and we discuss four key implications of this heterogeneity for social science and regional research.</p>

            <h3><i>Rethinking Propaganda: How Authoritarian Media Cultivate Loyal Audiences</i></h3>
            <p><strong>Forthcoming at Cambridge University Press</strong></p>
            
            <p>My book sheds light on a new model of state media in consolidated autocracies such as Russia. While conventional theories view propaganda as top-down messaging used to persuade, intimidate, or confuse citizens, I argue that propaganda can be a tool of regime maintenance that reinforces the relationship between the autocrat and supporters. This model, which I call service propaganda, borrows tactics from partisan media outlets, combining attractive political narratives that reaffirm pro-regime identities with tailored, engaging news reporting.</p>

            <p>In the book, I explain and document the tactics of service propaganda using a corpus of over 100,000 Russian state media stories and an advanced machine learning classifier. I then demonstrate through a series of surveys and experiments that pro-Putin Russians genuinely value state media reporting for its political aspects and the information it offers, while viewing independent media as biased and unreliable. These analyses draw on my recent articles in the Journal of Politics and Political Communication. Further, I show that the Kremlin's echo chamber remained attractive to Russians during a major political shock—Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. State-run outlets sustained and adjusted their service propaganda model in daily reporting throughout the invasion, helping the Kremlin to ensure public support for the war and acquiescence to it. More generally, my theory of propaganda as a maintenance tool helps explain the longevity and mass legitimacy of autocrats such as Vladimir Putin. The book's research has also been featured in prominent media outlets, including the Washington Post, PBS NewsHour, and the Financial Times.</p>

                <div class="paper-abstract">
                    State propaganda in autocracies often creates information bubbles, leaving citizens unwilling or unable to switch to alternative sources. This study shows that propaganda's sway can be decreased even without escaping such bubbles. In a panel experiment with 1,176 Russian citizens, we randomly assigned participants to analyze the reporting patterns of (i) propagandistic state-owned TV content only or (ii) both state-owned and balanced non-governmental TV content over four weeks. Two weeks after the intervention, both treatments reduced support for the authoritarian regime but did not undermine trust in or exposure to state media. Exploiting the differences in news channel composition across treatments, we find support for two mechanisms explaining these effects: increased attention to familiar media content and increased consumption of news from non-government sources. Subgroup analyses show that these mechanisms operate primarily among citizens who already exhibit skepticism toward the regime and propaganda.

                <div class="paper-abstract">
                    Foreign propaganda increasingly penetrates democratic discourse through domestic intermediaries. This study examines whether expert attribution enhances the credibility of authoritarian messaging and whether fact-based corrections can offset such credibility gains. In a survey experiment with 1,267 U.S. residents, I randomly varied whether statements echoing Russian propaganda about Ukraine were attributed to prominent American experts and whether these statements were accompanied by corrections. Results show that attribution to a renowned political scientist substantially increased statement credibility among Republicans, while attribution to a government official had no effect. However, factual corrections consistently reduced propaganda credibility regardless of source attribution, offsetting expert credibility premiums. These findings illuminate a critical vulnerability in democratic discourse—the exploitation of expert authority to legitimize foreign narratives. At the same time, they highlight the weakness of such borrowed authority, as it can be effectively countered by evidence.

                <div class="paper-abstract">
                    Politicians frequently attempt to deflect criticism and responsibility for wrongdoing by raising irrelevant issues or counter-accusations. This practice, known as whataboutism, was a common Soviet propaganda tactic during the Cold War and has since become a widely used rhetorical strategy in contemporary political debates. But does this propaganda strategy influence political attitudes and, if so, how? This paper tests the impact of whataboutism by Russian authorities on political attitudes using original survey experiments of nationally representative populations in Russia. We investigate how reminders by Russian authorities of foreign countries' record on salient policy issues influence citizens' evaluation of both countries' record on the same issue. We hypothesize that such reminders will depress Russians' evaluations of the situation not only in the target country but in Russia as well, increasing overall cynicism about their own country's politics.

                <div class="paper-abstract">
                    Political polarization is a pressing problem around the world and social media have come under scrutiny for their possible role in facilitating it. In democracies, some companies or governments restrict online expression or block access to certain platforms. In autocracies, digital restrictions are used widely to stem oppositional activity, often under the pretense of fighting extremism. Via a series of conjoint experiments in the U.S., China, Germany, and Brazil, we examine support for social media moderation and partisan disagreements about it. We offer important corrections to the existing studies of public opinion on social media: there is a broad cross-country consensus about restricting harmful online speech, and partisan disagreements about content moderation are weaker than some previous research suggests.

                    Mistrust is a common cause of conflict between individuals belonging to different identity groups. When can such mistrust be overcome? We study this question using an experiment based on a trust game between members of different social identity groups. In particular, we study the effect of hearing about positive interactions across group lines on the willingness of individuals to take a chance on cooperating with outgroup members. We field the experiment in Kazakhstan, focusing on relations between Kazakhs and Russians.

                <div class="paper-authors">With Julia A. Minson, Aaron Erlich, Jordan Gans-Morse, Christopher Higgins, and others</div>
                <div class="paper-abstract">
                    In response to Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, citizen-led communication campaigns leveraged modern information technology to transmit millions of messages providing uncensored information to Russians via emails, texts, social media apps, and website commentary. Yet it remains unclear to what extent such initiatives can penetrate authoritarian censorship and propaganda, and which types of messaging are most likely to succeed. To investigate, we partnered with Mail2Ru, a prominent citizen-led grassroots initiative, to conduct two pre-registered field experiments on the effectiveness of citizen-to-citizen email communication. For Study 1, a large-scale “mega-study,” we invited behavioral science experts to design theoretically informed persuasive messages encouraging Russians to watch an uncensored video about the invasion. Approximately 260,000 email recipients were randomly assigned one of eleven treatments or two control conditions. Study 1 showed that information technology's scalability enables even poorly designed messages to engage large audiences, but also that most expert-designed messages failed to outperform controls. Our top-performing intervention, however, nearly doubled engagement with the video. Study 2 successfully replicated the benefits of our top-performing intervention six months later, confirming its robustness. Study 3 probed mechanisms underlying our field experiment results, producing initial evidence that in the challenging context of censorship and repression, strategies emphasizing receptiveness and respectful engagement with opposing perspectives might be most effective. Together, these findings offer evidence-based guidance for citizen-led efforts to counter authoritarian propaganda.

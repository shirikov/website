									<p style="font-weight:bold">Who Trusts State-Run Media? Polarized Perceptions of News Credibility in Non-Democracies</p>
									<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3686299">View at SSRN</a>; poster with key results <a href="files/Shirikov_CESS_poster.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> (presented at NYU CESS conference in 2021)</p>
									<p>
									Recent research posits that authoritarian regimes increasingly rely on information manipulation for political survival. A puzzle in such accounts is that citizens in autocracies often have a choice of information sources yet trust propagandistic state media. I propose that this trust is largely explained by political like-mindedness, whereby two psychological mechanisms---confirmation bias and motivated reasoning---prompt government supporters to overestimate the trustworthiness of state-run media. I test these ideas in three studies situated in Russia. In two randomized experiments, I demonstrate that supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin trust reports from state media more than they trust reports from independent media. Additional survey evidence suggests that such trust is grounded in supporters' propensity to underestimate the bias of state media and the degree of government interference in these media. Thus, biased perceptions of media can make citizens more receptive to propaganda and reduce the threat of independent media to authoritarian rule.</p>

									<p><b>The Oligarch Vanishes: Defensive Ownership, Property Rights, and Political Connections</b> <i>(With John Earle, Scott Gehlbach and Solomiya Shpak)</i></p>

									<p>
									We examine the use of proxies, shell companies, and offshore firms to defend property against seizure by private and state actors. Our theoretical framework emphasizes the role of political connections in defensive ownership. Linking information from investigative journalists on the key holdings of numerous Ukrainian oligarchs with firm-level administrative data on formal ownership ties, we observe some form of defensive ownership among more than two-thirds of oligarch-controlled firms, but such conduct is much less common for those connected to the incumbent regime. Further exploiting the abrupt shock to political connections that accompanied the Orange Revolution, we find a sharp rise in defensive ownership among previously connected oligarchs.</p>

									<p style="font-weight:bold">Fake News for All: Polarization and Belief in
Misinformation in Russia</p>
									<p>
									How do citizens make judgments about news information in authoritarian regimes? I theorize that in contemporary autocracies, as the availability of information sources increases, citizens can sort into consuming like-minded news, and they are vulnerable to false messages that are consistent with their political dispositions and with the slant of their preferred media. I test this expectation using two surveys, in which over 47,000 Russians evaluated more than 80 true and false news headlines. On average, citizens who learn news from state media and those who support Russian President Vladimir Putin are slightly less correct in their evaluations than opposition-minded respondents and those who consume non-state media. However, as hypothesized, the former often fail to recognize false messages with a pro-government slant, whereas the latter often fall for falsehoods that go against propaganda narratives. Both groups are less likely to correctly assess true incongruent messages. Those Putin supporters and critics who consume politically congruent media disagree about news veracity even more strongly. These biases have important implications for our understanding of citizens' political knowledge and for the popularity of authoritarian rule.</p>

									<p style="font-weight:bold">Is Trust in Media Decreasing? Evidence from the World Values Survey</p>
									<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3754404">View at SSRN</a></p>

									<p>
									Scholars and observers are increasingly concerned that confidence in mainstream media is decreasing, which could undermine the democratic political process and make citizens more vulnerable to manipulation. Various surveys have documented dwindling confidence in media in the U.S. and other democracies, but so far this research has not established whether this decline is a global trend. I suggest a more robust approach using data from the World Values Survey to establish worldwide trends in attitudes. The resulting analysis shows there has been some decline in confidence in media since the early 1990s, but there is no evidence of a decline among stable democracies. Confidence in media has been decreasing instead in democratizing countries and other states that have undergone substantial political changes.</p>

									<p><b>A Model of Censorship and Propaganda</b> <i>(With Scott Gehlbach, Zhaotian Luo, and Dmitriy Vorobyev)</i></p>
									<p>
									A fundamental constraint of information design is that propaganda must be believed to be effective. The presence of outside information tightens this constraint. We extend the canonical two-state, two-action of Bayesian persuasion to endogenize the presence of such information. The sender (government) chooses both the precision of an outside signal—it chooses a level of censorship—and a probability distribution over propaganda messages, where the distribution can be conditioned on the outside signal. The government bears an opportunity cost of censorship, in that the government relies on outside information to decide whether to repress rather than persuade. In equilibrium, the government may employ censorship and propaganda alongside repression; many combinations of propaganda and censorship may be behaviorally equivalent. Under plausible additional assumptions, we predict a positive correlation between censorship and propaganda that is decreasing in the cost of repression.</p>

									<p><b>Smart Ways to Use a Postcommunist Dummy</b> <i>(With Dmitrii Kofanov and Yoshiko M. Herrera)</i></p>
									<p>
									Recent work has questioned the contemporary meaning of Eurasia as a region and postcommunism as concept. Nevertheless, postcommunism is still frequently used as a dummy variable in social science research. In this paper we review ways that the postcommunist dummy has been used in existing quantitative work, and we then employ advanced clustering methods to examine how the 27 postcommunist countries of Eurasia, as well as other countries of Western Europe and Asia, cluster in terms of political, economic, social, demographic, and value-based dimensions, based on data from around 2000 and 2014.  We find little evidence that postcommunist countries are distinct from Western European or Asian countries on most dimensions or that they coherently group together. This analysis provides a more systematic understanding of the heterogeneity of postcommunist countries, and we discuss the key implications of this heterogeneity for quantitative social science research.</p>
